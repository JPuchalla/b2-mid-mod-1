# User Story 2 , Surgery Show Page
# As a visitor
# When I visit the surgery index page
# I can click on any surgery title to take me to that surgery’s show page
# And on the show page I see the title and operating room number of that surgery
# And I see a section of the page that says "Other surgeries happening this day of the week:"
# And under that header I see titles of all surgeries that happen on the same day of the week as this surgery.
# (Note: You do not need to use the created_at or updated_at columns for Surgeries)
